I had previously installed git and created an account on git-hub.

I made a new local repo named thesis_1.
* mkdir thesis_1
 

Firstly I set my name and email using:
* git config --global user.name "Aine-Halpin"

* git config --global user.email "aihalpin@tcd.ie"

I moved my tar ball to my thesis_1 directory and archived it.
* tar xvf prac21_20235432.tar


I used the command:
* git add fastqc_files.py README.txt trimmed_out_1 fastqc_out test_dataset trimm_script.py
this added the files to staging

I committed the files to the local repo using:

* git commit -m "first commit"

I then added and commited this markdown document however i made changes to
it and the README.txt file and pushed later versions to my github as the 
earlier versions served little purpose
 
On my github account I made a new repository to match my local repository thesis 1.

I used the following command to push my files :
* git remote set-url origin https://github.com/Aine-Halpin/thesis_1.git

* git push origin master

The files now appear in a thesis_1 folder within my thesis_1 repository on github.
