I have installed git and created an account on git-hub.

I made a new local repo named thesis_1. 

Firstly I set my name and email using:
**git config --global user.name "First Last"
git config --global user.email "user@domain

I moved my tar ball to my thesis_1 directory and archived it.

I used the command:
**git add fastqc_files.py README.txt trimmed_out_1 fastqc_out test_dataset trimm_script.py

and committed 

**git commit -m "first commit"

I then added and commited this markdown document.


after commiting i looked at the git log and git diff outputs:

On my github account I made a new repository to match my local repository thesis 1.

I used the following command to push my files :
*git remote set-url origin https://github.com/Aine-Halpin/project.git

*git push origin master

The files now appear in a thesis_1 folder within my thesis_1 repository on github.
